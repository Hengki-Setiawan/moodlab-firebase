## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gradient from Blue (#4285F4) to Purple (#9C27B0) to Pink (#E91E63) to represent data, creativity, and Gen Z energy.
- Background color: Clean White (#FFFFFF) for a modern, readable aesthetic.
- Text color: Dark Gray (#1A1A1A) to ensure high readability.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean, and geometric feel, ideal for headlines and shorter text blocks.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, readable style in longer content. If 'Poppins' is chosen as the single font, use it in all text.
- Use modern, minimalist icons to represent services. Icons should use the primary color gradient subtly.
- Use a grid-based layout for the portfolio and team sections to provide a clean, organized look.
- Subtle animations and transitions on page load and when scrolling to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
